# Product Description
Poverty, affecting 46 percent of the global population, remains one of the most pressing challenges. Tragically, approximately one-third of all human deaths each year are linked to poverty-related causes. To address this critical issue, we advocate for an end to poverty and a commitment to mutual assistance. So what is our solution? We proudly present the PIFM (Paying It Forward Market) mobile application.
   <br /> The mission of PIFM is to act as a bridge between those in need and those willing to help. 
   In PIFM, which is very simple to use, the products purchased by helpful people are converted into coupons and accumulated. Those in need are determined by filling out the form. Registered needy people can benefit from these coupons by selecting a limited number of their needs from the market of their choice.<br />
   Now let's take a look at the PIFM application together. First, we must register with PIFM and log in with an appropriate email address. We then encounter two perspectives. First of all, let's assume you are helpful. In this case, all you have to do is click on the Give It button and buy the product from the market you want. In this way, the product you purchase will turn into a coupon for those in need to use.<br />
  From another perspective, let's assume that you are one of the people in need determined by the form. In this case, you need to click on the Give It Off button, select a limited number of products from the market, and complete your shopping. In this way, the products purchased by the helpful person and converted into coupons will be transferred to your account. Finally, you can buy your coupon products from any market you want without paying any fee, since they have already been paid for by a helpful person.
